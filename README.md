Comment system for the frontend in http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/

The Real World Haskell book includes a very nice commenting system for its online version. Including comments for each paragraph like in Medium.

Although one can copy their frontend easily from the browser, I didn't manage to find the backend.

This is a Flask implementation of the backend.

Create a file `config.py` with

    PASSWORD = 'yoursecret'
